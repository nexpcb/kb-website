## What are INCOTERMS?

"International Rules for the Interpretation of Trade Terms" (abbreviated to INCOTERMS) is the basic international rules for international trade formulated by the International Chamber of Commerce. Incoterms are provisions that define the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in the operation of international trading system, and are the authoritative rules for determining how costs and risks are allocated to the parties.

 
## What are international trade terms? 

There are 11 types of international trade terms in total. The 11 types are further divided into two categories: 

* The first category is applicable to **any mode of transportation** where the **goods are not handed over on board or alongside the vessel.**                                       
  * EXW 
  * FCA 
  * CPT 
  * CIP 
  * DAP 
  * DPU 
  * DDP 


* The second category is applicable for **sea transportation** and designed for **goods placed on board, alongside the vessel or in port.**                         
  * FAS 
  * FOB 
  * CFR 
  * CIF 
 

## What are the costs involved and who are responsible for the trade?

The costs involved and the responsible parties are different for each Incoterm. 

### 1. Ex Works（EXW) 

Costs and responsibilities of buyers and sellers: 

  * In terms of transportation the seller bears "no" costs.                    
  * The buyer bears **insurance premium + trucking charges or loading fees + customs declaration fees + terminal handling charges + ocean freight + customs clearance fees + customs duties + delivery fees (including additional costs that may be incurred)**. 
The cost of seller is controllable and the buyer will cover all the expenses. 

  * In terms of the division of responsibilities, the seller is only responsible for delivering the goods to the buyer or the buyer's carrier.                  
  * The **buyer takes all the responsibilities** after delivery of the goods by the seller. 
The seller's responsibility is controllable, while the buyer shoulders a great responsibility.                  

To sum up, the seller only needs to produce the goods and deliver them to the buyer or buyer's carrier at their own factory! All the expenses and responsibilities shall be borne by the buyer. 
 

### 2. Free Carrier（FCA）

Costs and responsibilities of buyers and sellers:

Seller delivers the goods either at its own factory or at other locations, such as the warehouse of the buyer's carrier.  

If the goods are **delivered at the buyer's factory**,                            
  * In terms of transportation, the seller bears "no" cost.               
  * The buyer bears **insurance premium + trucking charges or loading fees+ customs declaration fees + terminal handling charges + ocean freight + customs clearance fees + customs duties + delivery fees (including additional costs that may be incurred)**.              

  The seller's responsibility is controllable, while the buyer shoulders a great responsibility. 

If the goods are delivered at the **warehouse of the buyer's carrier**,                                                
  * Seller needs to pay the **inland charges + warehouse fees** for the delivery from factory to warehouse.             
  * The buyer bears **insurance premium + customs declaration fees + terminal handling charges + ocean freight + customs clearance fees + customs duties + delivery fees (including additional costs that may be incurred)**.

The seller's costs and responsibilities under this clause are similar to those in the case of [FCA](/articles/Incoterms/#2-free-carrierfca), *except* for the **final place of delivery**. The final place of delivery determines the costs and responsibilities to be borne by the seller. Once the goods are delivered to the buyer or buyer's carrier, the responsibility then transfers.

CIF is almost the same as [CFR](/articles/Incoterms/#10-cost-and-freightcfr), except that the insurance premium is borne by the seller under the clause of CIF. 
To sum up, the seller is responsible for delivering the goods to the port agreed with the buyer and pay the insurance premium, then the remaining responsibilities and costs are transferred to the buyer. 

  

 
 
To agree on an Incoterm, the seller should first explain the trade terms of the price when quoting to the customer. If no Incoterm was agreed on, the trade can't happen. Incoterms should be agreed first before the trade happens since there should be a responsible party to pay the freight and taxes, also to take risks throughout each process. 

Currently, a lot of companies adopt the terms of EXW and CNF as the most commonly used terms for international dealings. NexPCB commonly accept deals by adopting EXW, FCA, FOB, CFR, and CIF. 
As long as all legal conditions are satisfied, the international trade can be carried out according to any negotiated term, and there will be no disputes under normal circumstances.

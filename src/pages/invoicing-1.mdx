Classification of invoices

In international trade, different invoices are used for different purposes, and different invoice names indicate different types of invoices. Here are the common types of invoices and their preparation methods:

### 1. Commercial Invoice

If the L/C regulations are INVOICE (invoice), COMMERCIAL INVOICE (commercial invoice), SHIPPING INVOICE (shipment invoice), TRADE INVOICE (trade invoice), all can be mastered according to the commercial invoice, generally only need to send the invoice The name is printed with the words "INVOICE".

### 2. Detailed Invoice

If the L/C stipulates "DETAILED INVOICE", then if the word "INVOICE" is printed in the invoice, "DETAILED" must be added in front of it, and the content of the invoice should include the name, specification, quantity, unit price, price conditions, The total value and so on are listed in detail.

### 3. Verified Invoice

The verified invoice is a kind of invoice that proves the authenticity and correctness of the content contained in it. The content of the verification depends on the requirements of the importer, such as: the content of the invoice is true and correct, the real place of origin of the goods, the quality of the goods conforms to the contract, The price is correct and more. If the L/C stipulates "CERTIFIED INVOICE", the name of the invoice should be printed as it is, and at the same time, the words "E. &. O.E." usually printed under the invoice should be crossed out, and "WE HERE BY CERTIFY THAT THE CONTENTS OF INVOICE" should usually be indicated in the invoice HERE INARE TRUE & CORRECT".

Some countries have a certain format for confirming the invoice, which is used as a certificate of lower tariff or tax exemption for customs clearance of goods import. In some regions, importers can use real invoices instead of customs invoices to handle customs clearance or obtain preferential tariffs. Some importers prove that the commission is not included in the price according to the actual invoice, so as to claim extra-price remuneration.

If the L/C stipulates "VISAED INVOIE" (visa invoice) and specifies the visa person, the visa person needs to stamp and sign on the invoice as a visa, and add a statement of proof. If the visa person is not specified in the certificate, it will be exported The International Chamber of Commerce is the visa holder, and the rest are the same as the certified invoice. 

### 4. Receipt Invoice or Payment Invoice

If the L/C requires "RECEIPTINVOICE", the name should be typed, and the payment has been received clause should be added at the signature of the invoice: VALUE/PAYMENT RECEIVED UNDER CREDIT NO.×××ISSUED BY×××BANK. This kind of invoice is often used under the sight payment letter of credit, and its purpose is to replace the payment receipt with a commercial invoice without the need to issue a draft. Because bills of exchange need to be stamped with revenue stamps in some countries, some importers also require such invoices in order to avoid the burden of stamp duty. 

### 5. Manufacturer's Invoice

The manufacturer's invoice is a sales certificate issued by the manufacturer of the exported goods to express the ex-factory price in domestic currency. Its purpose is to be used by the customs of the importing country for valuation, tax verification, checking whether there is price-cutting dumping, and collecting anti-dumping duties. If L/C requires "MANUFACTURERS INVOICE", the name of the invoice should be typed as it is, and attention should be paid when copying: (a) The date of issue of the invoice should be earlier than the date of the commercial invoice. (b) The price is the domestic market price expressed in the currency of the exporting country. The filling method is the same as that of the customs invoice, but it should be noted that the ex-factory price cannot be higher than the invoice price, and should be appropriately discounted (generally 10% or 15% off the FOB price), so as not to be levied by the customs of the importing country as dumping Anti-dumping duties lead to huge losses. (c) The statement "WE HERE BY CERTIFY THAT WE ARE ACTUAL MANUFACTURER OF THE GOODS INVOICED" should be added to the invoice to prove the manufacturer. (d) The payee is the exporter, but the bill issuer is the manufacturer, and the person in charge of the factory should sign and seal the invoice. (e) When the goods leave the factory, there is generally no export shipping mark, so unless it is clearly stipulated in the letter of credit, the manufacturer's invoice does not need to be marked. 

 

### 6. Proforma Invoice or Advance Invoice

Proforma invoice or advance invoice is mainly used for reference when the buyer accepts the quotation, or when applying for an import license or foreign exchange approval to the domestic trade management authority or foreign exchange management authority after signing the contract. It is an informal reference invoice issued by the seller at the buyer's request before the transaction. The price in it is only an estimated price and cannot be used as a settlement document, and has no final binding force on both parties to the transaction. Formal transactions also need to issue a formal invoice.

If the L/C stipulates that "PROFORMA INVOICE" is required, the name should be typed when making the bill, and the words "for the merchant to apply for a license" or "this transaction is valid after the seller's final confirmation" are indicated in the invoice. Once the buyer accepts the proforma invoice, it is an affirmative contract, and both parties handle various businesses according to the content of the proforma invoice.

 

### 7. Sample Invoice or Small Invoice

Sample invoice, also known as the small invoice is a list issued by the seller when sending samples to the buyer, for use in import declaration.

 

### 8. Consular Invoice

The consular invoice is an invoice that the exporter fills in according to the fixed format formulated by the consulate of the importing country in the exporting country and signed by the consulate. 

Some Latin American countries stipulate that consular invoices must be used for imports for several functions:

* to determine the origin of the goods 
* to clarify differential treatment tariffs
* to verify whether the invoice price is reasonable or whether there is a dumping problem

Consular invoices are official documents, and the format is generally uniform for all countries. However, some countries will only require the **commercial invoice issued by the seller, which will then be signed by the consul of the country**. This kind of invoice is called the **consular visa invoice (CONSULARLEGALIZED INVOICE)**. 

The content that should be indicated in the consular invoice depends on the invoice certification terms on the L/C. Generally, it must be indicated that _"the goods shipped are manufactured/produced by XX (exporting country)"_.

 

### 9. Consignment Invoice

The consignment invoice is the invoice issued by the seller to the buyer as the basis for pricing when the goods are consigned.

### 10. Customs Invoice or CCVO

A customs invoice is an invoice in a specific format that must be provided for import declarations stipulated by the customs authority of the importing country. Therefore, it is also called the **COMBINED CERTIFICATE OF VALUE AND ORIGIN (C.C.V.O.).**

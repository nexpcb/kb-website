Computer Numeric Control (CNC) is an automated machining process that takes advantage of the advancements that took place in high precision machinery in the last 50 years. With CNC, you get repeatable, precise milling, drilling, lathes and other kinds of manufacturing. Although CNC can refer to additive, subtractive and formative manufacturing methods, the most commonly used CNC methods listed below are all subtractive manufacturing methods. 

## Supported CNC Methods

Most commonly used CNC methods are:

1.   Milling

2.   Drilling

3.   Turning

4.   Grinding

5.   Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM)

### Milling

CNC Milling uses a cutting tool that rotates and presses against the workpiece to remove layers of material.

NexPCB's standard milling process is:

-   5-Axis,

-   accurate to ±0.05mm, and 

-   has a standard surface roughness of Ra1.6 µm.

We also provide ±0.02 tolerances for engineering/scientific applications.

### Drilling

We offer both CNC and manual bench drills.

Our CNC drills can make threads, multi-stepped holes, and chamfering.  

### Turning

CNC Turning moves and rotates the workpiece onto a stationary cutting tool to create its shape.

NexPCB's standard turning process is:

-   Typically 4-axis,

-   Accurate to ±0.05mm

### Grinding

CNC grinding machine is made up of a rotating tool which removes the surface of a workpiece by layer to create smoother surface finishes.

NexPCB supports both surface grinders and centerless grinders, with the standards of

-   Accuracy up to ±0.01mm

-   Typical standard surface roughness output of Ra0.8 µm.

-   Minimum surface roughness of Ra0.4 µm, and maximum at Ra1.6 µm.

### Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM)

EDM, or also known as spark machining is an electro-thermal process of using electricity to cut into products to create the desired shape.  The process runs high electric signals along a short wire which is pre-programmed to move according to the shape contour. The wire is continuously changed as it erodes during the cutting process, and a billet of deionized water is sprayed during the process to cool and clean the product from the residue debris.

EDM is applicable for processes that require tight tolerance, such as for slots and eyelets. We usually use the process to create injection molding molds. It uses 3 main components: the guide which is usually made up of diamond, the heated wire commonly made from brass, and the deionized water which will be ionized at the end of the process.

Embossing or *debossing* is a process to create reliefs across a surface. The process is done by applying heat pressure to a pre-made stamp on top (**emboss**), or bottom (**deboss**) of the surface. Embossing process will create a raised surface, while the debossing process will create a sunken surface. These processes are fast and cost-effective for batch productions.

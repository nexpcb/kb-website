Designing a PCB, and communicating those design decisions depends on a series of files such as circuit schematic designs, Bill-of-Materials, PCB layouts and stackup design information.

In order to allow for interoperability between the large number of Electronics Design software such as Allegro, Altium Designer, KiCAD and Eagle, a collection of files called Gerbers were developed. Gerber files allow for understanding PCB designs without being locked into a certain design software.

## File Types

When generating your first PCB design, there are 2 key files you should prepare:

### CAD Aperture files

In the format of RS-274X (Gerber x1), Gerber x2, IPC-2581, ODB++

### BOM (Bill of Materials)

In the format of TXT, PDF, CSV, XLSV, etc.

When generating your BOM files, there are few important components to be included:

- Component name

- MPN (Manufacturer Part Number)

- Tag number, the component number in your design files

- Quantity

- Description

- Manufacturer

- MPN of the component's alternative

- Other remarks

In addition to the two above, two other file types could also be prepared to provide further information about your PCB:

### Mechanical Files 

These contain the PCB's dimensions and structure

In the format of DXF, STEP, or DWG

These Mechanical files should contain information about:

- The precise PCB outline.

- The exact position and size of some internal grooves or cuts.

- Specific tolerance requirements.

- It can also include some customized panel information, such as drilling patterns, hole position information, layer stacking, positioning holes, special production requirements, etc.

#### Schematic Diagram Files

| File Type                  | Format    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DXF/DWG                    | .dxf .dwg | DXF: CAD drawing exchange format (vector) (ASCII or binary); DWG: CAD drawing file, binary **AutoCAD** supports both files. |
| Netlist Schematic          | .NET      | It is a netlist, you can choose a document or a project, and choose the type of netlist                                     |
| Orcad SDT Schematic        | .sch      | SDT3/4 binary schematic file, AD cannot be opened                                                                           |
| Orcad v7 Capture Design    | .dsn      | Capture design files will be automatically converted, prone to errors and failures                                          |
| P-CAD V16 Schematic Design | .sch      | ASCII file                                                                                                                  |

#### PCB Design files

Which are compiled or generated by Allegro, Altium Designer, Mentor series, EAGLE, ZUKEN, KiCAD, etc., if you want to give your manufacturer the ability to easily alter designs, as Gerber files themselves aren't editable.

In NexPCB, we accept all the file formats mentioned above. However, we would highly recommend using Allegro and Altium Designer for the choice of EDA.

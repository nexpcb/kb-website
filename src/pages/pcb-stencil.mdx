PCB stencil plays an important role in PCB layout and SMT. PCB stencils restrict the PCB designs, which also then affect the PCB production rates. Before discussing these issues, we still need to understand its definition and how it works.

A PCB stencil is usually made up of a thin steel sheet that is holed according to the pattern of pads to be engraved in the PCB. A layer of solder will then be printed onto the stencil, and placed on top of a bare PCB. When pulled out, the solder paste will be on the positions of the pads designed. Next, subsequent patching and flow soldering processes will be continued. In short, a PCB stencil is a mold-like auxiliary tool for printing solder paste. 

This being said, one of the most necessary elements of LAYOUT, which has its own working principles and application scenarios that should be understood first. 

 

## The main influencing factors of stencil tin brushing

Let's first talk about the factors that affect the tin-brushing effect of the stencil

The first is the thickness. The thickness of the stencil is the primary factor to determine the amount of tin. This is also relatively easy to understand. The thicker the tin, the greater the amount of tin, and the thinner the smaller the amount of tin. But this thickness needs to be appropriate. Table 3-1 in IPC-7525A has a recommended table for lead-containing solder paste. It can be seen that the thickness of the stencil is different from that of the package, and the type of pin corresponds to the difference in the pin gap.

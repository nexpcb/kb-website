PCB stencil plays an important role in PCB layout and SMT. PCB stencils restrict the PCB designs, which also then affect the PCB production rates. Before discussing these issues, we still need to understand its definition and how it works.

A PCB stencil is usually made up of a thin steel sheet that is holed according to the pattern of pads to be engraved in the PCB. A solder paste layer will then be printed onto the stencil, and placed on top of a bare PCB. When pulled out, the solder paste will be on the positions of the pads designed. Next, subsequent patching and flow soldering processes will be continued. In short, a PCB stencil is a mold-like auxiliary tool for printing solder paste.

This being said a PCB stencil is the most crucial part of creating a PCB layout. To understand more about its role, we'll be discussing its own working principles and application scenarios that should be understood first.

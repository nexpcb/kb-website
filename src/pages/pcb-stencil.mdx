PCB stencil plays an important role in PCB layout and SMT. PCB stencils restrict the PCB designs, which also then affect the PCB production rates. Before discussing these issues, we still need to understand its definition and how it works.

A PCB stencil is usually made up of a thin steel sheet that is holed according to the pattern of pads to be engraved in the PCB. A solder paste layer will then be printed onto the stencil, and placed on top of a bare PCB. When pulled out, the solder paste will be on the positions of the pads designed. Next, subsequent patching and flow soldering processes will be continued. In short, a PCB stencil is a mold-like auxiliary tool for printing solder paste.

This being said a PCB stencil is the most crucial part of creating a PCB layout. To understand more about its role, we'll be discussing its own working principles and application scenarios that should be understood first.

## Stencil Mesh Design Considerations 

In actual design, there are more factors affecting solder paste printing, such as

1. **Types of solder paste**

Leaded solder paste is more fluid than lead-free solder paste. Hence, using leaded solder paste will generally shrink the printed pad pattern. Most companies nowadays use **lead-free solder paste**, in which the **mesh-to-pad ratio are 1:1** -- i.e., it's always assumed there's no solder paste shrinkage. 

2. **The particle size of solder paste**

Solder paste comes in different sizes. When solder paste with larger particle sizes is used for narrow meshes or thin stencils, the amount of solder placed may not be sufficient. Therefore, smaller solder paste particles are usually required for small areas and thin stencils.

3. **Geometry of opening side walls**

Irregular geometric shapes, especially sharp angles, will increase the risk of the solder paste coming out patchy. When the printed solder paste is not smooth, the soldering process becomes harder and the components will fall off easily. Therefore, some smaller-sized package pads will be designed as arc pads and rectangular small-sized pads are chamfered or elongated.

4. **Stencil mesh wall smoothness**

Most stencils are now being made using the laser cutting process. Thus, the finish of these stencils' walls is generally very smooth, which eases the process of solder paste placement. However, some thicker stencils are still made with a stamping process, which requires an additional polishing process to create a smooth inner wall. 

5. **Stencil separation speed**

The separation speed of the printing machine will also affect the quality and effect of soldering. Usually, the solder paste used in combination with different placement factories will have some accumulated experience, and will also form a general requirement for the design opening. For example, manufacturer A will request to reduce the opening area, while manufacturer B may request to extend the length, chamfer, or change the shape of the opening for the same product.

What is custom packaging?

Custom packaging is a unique package designed from scratch around the specific needs of customers and products, rather than using a standard or prefabricated box or packaging, as close as possible to product placement, shipping, and sales. The custom packaging process includes modifying the shape, size, style, color, material, varnish, and other specifications of the packaging, etc.

Why do products need custom packaging?

Customized packaging plays a vital role in product sales. Whether it is the embodiment of the brand, the communication of product information or the enhancement of visual appeal, it is closely related to packaging. Well-designed packaging helps the brand stand out from the competition, enhances the customer's impression of the brand, and potential customers can feel the value of the product through the packaging. It can also attract target customers through eye-catching design and creative structural design. Product packaging is like a billboard for products. With the continuous improvement of living standards, people's visual requirements are also gradually increasing. The unique design can stimulate customers' curiosity and desire to buy.

Customization method:

Customers provide products, and we provide packaging design and customization according to product characteristics and sales needs;

Provide specific needs, we provide packaging design consultation and customization according to needs. Customers need to be notified: size, size, material, thickness, style, printing method, printing process, customized quantity (generally, the more the quantity, the lower the price), additional processes, etc. Because it involves proofing, loss, etc., it is necessary to know all the requirements in order to achieve accurate quotations. For example, the thickness and material of paper (cardboard + special paper / double copper paper / single powder card, etc.) will affect the price fluctuation, complex printing process (bronzing / embossing / lamination / die-cutting / partial UV / reverse glazing, etc. ) will increase the difficulty of proofing, etc.

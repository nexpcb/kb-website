# Custom Packaging

## What is custom packaging?

Custom packaging is a unique package designed from scratch around the specific needs of customers and products, rather than using a standard or prefabricated box or packaging, as close as possible to product placement, shipping, and sales. The custom packaging process includes modifying the shape, size, style, color, material, varnish, and other specifications of the packaging, etc.

  

## Why do products need custom packaging?

Customized packaging plays a vital role in **product sales**. It's main roles include:

* to show-off the brand
* to display product information 
* for aesthetics 

A well-designed packaging helps the brand stand out from the competition, enhances the customer's impression of the brand, and gives an overview of the product's value. 

A well-designed packaging will also attract customers through eye-catching design and creative structural design. Product packaging is like the billboard for products: **they promote the products.** Nowadays, what attracts a person's attention has become more and more niche. Having a unique packaging design will definitely stimulate customers' curiosity and desire to buy.

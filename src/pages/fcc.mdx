FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is a mandatory certification for electronic products to enter the US market. The certification is applicable in more than 50 states across the US, also in Canada, and some countries in Central and South America.

EMC products, with 9kHz to 3000GHz operation, need to have FCC certification. The certification standard controls the radio transmission, communication principles, and many other operating features of the electronics. Radio interference limits and measurement methods, as well as the certification system and organizational management system, are also regulated by the FCC.

The common products regulated by the FCC are personal computers, CD players, printers, radios, fax machines, video game consoles, electronic toys, televisions, and microwave ovens.

These products are further classified into 2 categories,

* **Class A,** which are the electronics used for commercial or industrial use, and
* **Class B,** which are electronics meant for household use.

The FCC has stricter requirements for **Class B** products, with lower limit values than **Class A**. For most electronic and electrical products, the main standards are _FCC Part 15_ and _FCC Part 18_.

## FCC Options

The FCC has three options for equipment approval: Verification, Declaration of Conformity (DoC), and Certification. Each of these certification types is used for different applications and has different testing and declaration. Hence, they all need specific testing laboratories to obtain FCC accreditation.

### Verification

During the process, the manufacturer or importer ensures that its products undergo the necessary testing to confirm that the product meets the relevant technical standards and has completed the FCC certification process, with a legit test report.

Electronic products suitable for the ‘Verification’ type include 

* Commercial computers
* TV and FM receivers
* Industrial, scientific, and medical equipment for non-mass consumer use under FCC Rule _Part 18._

### Declaration of Conformity (DoC)

The manufacturer or importer of the product tests the product at a qualified testing agency designated by the FCC to ensure that the equipment complies with the relevant technical standards and retains the test report. The certification body must be authorized by **NVLAP/A2LA**.

Electronic applications suitable for the ‘DoC’ certification include:

* Household computers and their peripherals
* Broadcast receivers
* Super-regenerative receivers
* other receivers listed on the FCC Rule _Part 15_,
* TV interface equipment
* Cable system terminal equipment
* Industrial and scientific research equipment for consumers listed in _Part 18_
* Medical equipment.

### Certification

The certification process gives an ID to the certified product. Certification is the process by which FCC signs equipment approval based on application and test data. FCC reviews the samples (or photos) and test data submitted by the applicant and authorizes the device with an FCCID number if it meets the requirements of the FCC rules. All devices which are FCC-Certified would have an FCCID mark on them. 

Electronic applications suitable for the ‘Certification’ includes:

* Low-power transmitters such as cordless phones, remote controls for automatic doors, radio-controlled toys, and security alarm systems.
* _Part 15_ devices that intentionally emit radio frequency energy.
* _Part 18_ industrial, scientific research, and medical equipment.
* automatic frequency conversion receivers and super-regenerative receivers.
* TV interface equipment
* Personal computers and their peripherals.

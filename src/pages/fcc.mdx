FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is a mandatory certification for electronic products to enter the US market. The certification is applicable in more than 50 states across the US, also in Canada, and some countries in Central and South America.

EMC products, with 9kHz to 3000GHz operation, need to have FCC certification. The certification standard controls the radio transmission, communication principles, and many other operating features of the electronics. Radio interference limits and measurement methods, as well as the certification system and organizational management system, are also regulated by the FCC.

The common products regulated by the FCC are personal computers, CD players, printers, radios, fax machines, video game consoles, electronic toys, televisions, and microwave ovens.

These products are further classified into 2 categories,

* **Class A,** which are the electronics used for commercial or industrial use, and
* **Class B,** which are electronics meant for household use.

The FCC has stricter requirements for **Class B** products, with lower limit values than **Class A**. For most electronic and electrical products, the main standards are _FCC Part 15_ and _FCC Part 18_.

## Definitions

1\. Pure returns - returns

* **Customs return** generally refers to the management measures for the direct return of imported goods by the Customs Bureau. 
* **General returned goods** refer to the goods that have been declared for export or import, and are returned for import or export due to various reasons. 
* **Direct returned goods** means that the consignee or consignor of the imported goods, the person in charge of the original means of transport, or their agent (will be referred to as the parties) applies for direct return of the imported goods overseas after entering the country and before completing the customs clearance. This will be done according to the existing state regulations.

2\. Return for repair

It means that the goods exported to foreign countries are required to be returned and repaired during the warranty period due to quality reasons, and then sent abroad.

## Return reasons

A. After the outbound goods arrive at the destination country, they are rejected by foreign businessmen due to the reasons of the goods themselves, such as:

1\. Return due to packaging reasons;

2\. The return of the goods due to the need to upgrade the system of the goods itself;

3\. After the product leaves the factory, the parts fail and need to be replaced with new parts.

B. Customs and other agencies refuse to clear customs because the relevant documents do not match the actual product. For example, due to the carelessness of the exporter, the wooden frame has no IPPC certification mark, so it cannot be cleared in the destination country.

3\. Operation process

Return: If the return refers to the export of the goods because the customer is dissatisfied with the goods and requests to return the goods, only return them. If it is a refund, then it involves tax refunds and the foreign exchange is returned in the same way.

Rework: During the warranty period, the goods exported to foreign countries are required to be returned for repair due to quality reasons and then sent abroad. If it is returned for repair, there is still a deposit to be processed within the specified maintenance time.

1\. First go to the shipping company to exchange for the bill of lading;

2\. Declare to the customs;

3\. The declaring enterprise shall pay the deposit for return and repair to the customs (the refund time of the deposit is within 6 months, and it will not be refunded if it is overdue);

4\. After customs release, pick up the goods from the dock or warehouse to the factory warehouse;

5\. After the goods arrive at the factory, the enterprise needs to rework and repair them in time. Within 6 months from the date of import declaration, this part of the goods must be rebooked and declared to the customs and sent to the customer;

6\. After the customs export declaration is released, the customs clearance enterprise can apply to the customs for refund of the security deposit;

7\. The enterprise receives the security deposit directly refunded to the company's account by the customs;

Notes on import declaration for return and repair

1\. The period from export to return shall not exceed one year.

2\. There must be quality problems before they can be temporarily imported in the form of return for repair.

3\. According to the repair time of returning to the factory for half a year, if half a year is not enough for repair, you can apply to the customs for an extension of another half year, and you can apply for a maximum of 2 extensions. Within the repair period, you can apply for re-export at any time after the repair is completed.

4\. Return and repair method:

1\. Repair abroad. First find foreign engineers to find out the exact reason, then export and transport domestic materials to foreign countries, and then send domestic technicians to foreign countries for maintenance. For small volume and particularly sophisticated equipment, it can still be considered, but the domestic materials are not necessarily completely accurate. Foreign labor and logistics costs are relatively high, so it is not recommended.

2\. Return to factory for repair. Exported goods can be returned to the factory within a certain period of time. It is necessary to provide the current customs declaration form and related return materials to apply to the export customs. If there is an export tax refund, the refunded tax needs to be returned temporarily. There is a time limit for shipping to the factory, and an equivalent deposit must be paid.

3\. Express to domestic repair. high risk. The quantity is small, which is ok. If the goods are lost, the general logistics company can only pay several times the freight. If the volume is large, it is recommended not to go this way.

4\. Choose Hong Kong as the maintenance location

As a free trade port, Hong Kong is very developed in terms of logistics, but it is expensive in terms of maintenance costs such as labor costs and logistics costs. It can be judged according to specific circumstances such as the value of the goods, the maintenance process, and whether large-scale equipment is required.

5\. Choose a bonded area for maintenance

The bonded area is equivalent to the function of domestic and foreign customs, which means that the goods are still being repaired abroad, and the goods are returned to the bonded area for inspection and maintenance without applying to the customs for returning the goods, without paying a deposit, and without paying taxes. This is the way most factories will choose now.

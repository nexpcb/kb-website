Non-conforming products are products whose quality characteristics deviate from relevant technical requirements or engineering specifications of drawings. They are ones that didn't pass appropriate acceptance criteria, after inspection or testing. 

There are three kinds of con-conforming products: **waste, reprocessed** and **defective** products. Quality standards play a major role here, without which, there is no way to determine whether a product is qualified or not. 

It is a basic requirement of enterprises that non-conforming products are not allowed to leave the factory for delivery. Suspicious products shall be deemed non-conforming, and when some measuring instrument or testing equipment fails to work, all products inspected by the instrument and tested by the equipment will be regarded as non-conforming products.

The management of non-conforming products shall adhere to the principles of "3 NOs" and "3 NO PASSES".

The on-site management of non-conforming products mainly involves two tasks: 

1. Mark the non-conforming products


2. Immediately separate and store various non-conforming products after being marked, to avoid chaos in the production.

Non-conforming products will be further separated into different categories, based on their condition, and what approaches are to be taken after. This includes, **discard, rework, repair,** and **use of original products (Accept on Deviation).**

### Causes of Non-conforming Products

The cause of non-conforming products is also very diverse. It's mainly caused by operating mistakes, the usage of defective materials, or due to incorrect designs. will all result in con-conforming products. Generally speaking, the occurrence of non-conforming products is related to the following aspects, referred to below. 

1. Problems in the development and design of the product:

* Unclear manufacturing methods of product design.
* Illegible patterns and drawings, and inaccurate labeling.
* The design size of the product is inconsistent with the parts and assembly tolerances used in the production.
* The management of waste drawings is ineffective, resulting in the misuse of discarded drawings in production

2. Improper management of machines and equipment:

* Improper installation and design of machine.
* No calibration for machine and equipment for a long time.
* Poor quality of cutting tools, molds, and tools.
* Insufficient accuracy of gauge and testing equipment.
* Impact of temperature, humidity, and other environmental conditions on the equipment.
* Insufficient processing capacity of the equipment.
* Improper repair and maintenance of machinery and equipment.

3. Poor management of materials and accessories:

* Use of untested materials or accessories.
* Incorrect use of materials or accessories.
* Quality variation of materials and accessories.
* Use of poor materials or accessories.
* Use of alternative materials without precise validation in advance.

4.  Poor management of production activity:

* One-sided pursuit of output, and neglect of quality.
* Operators are on duty without training.
* No production operation instruction has been formulated for production activity control.
* Poor control of the production process.
* Employees lack self-awareness of quality control.

5. Quality inspection and control:

* No product quality plan has been formulated
* Testing equipment exceeds the deadline for calibration
* Incomplete quality regulations, methods, and countermeasures
* No effective quality control system has been formed
* Insufficient quality awareness of senior managers
* Inaccurate or imperfect quality standards

Non-conforming products are factories' unwanted output, but they are very difficult to avoid. Therefore, factories should first analyze the causes of non-conforming products from different aspects and find out the main reasons before implementing improvements.

### Disposing Non-conformance Product 

1. **Identification of non-conforming products**
2. **Marking of unqualified products**

   This is done to ensure that non-conforming products are not misused in the production process. All purchased goods, products in process, semi-finished products, finished products, and non-conforming products to be processed should have their own quality identification marks.
   1. Selecting a marker:
      * Sign: 

        Hang the corresponding sign on the outer package of the goods to mark it based on the categories or processing types of the goods. The signs used includes:
        * "to be tested"
        * "temporarily received"
        * "qualified"
        * "unqualified"
        * "to be processed"
        * "sealed"
        * "returns"
        * "reinspect"
        * "rework"
        * "repair"
        * "discard", etc. 

        The signs are mainly used to mark large goods or batches of products.
      * Labels

        This identification type shows information marked directly on the good. The information written will include the good's name, specification, color, material, source, order number, production date, quantity, etc.
      * Color code

        This color code can be plastered directly on the goods, on its outer packaging or on the label of the product.

        The color code usually has three types: green, yellow, and red. Among which:
        1. **Green**: indicates that the inspected product is qualified. 

           It is usually affixed to the bottom right corner of the surface of the product where it can be easily seen.
        2. **Yellow**: indicates that the quality of the inspected product has yet to be decided. 

           It is usually affixed to the upper right corner of the surface of the product so it can be easily seen.
        3. **Red**: indicates that the inspected product is unqualified. 

           It is usually affixed to the upper left corner of the surface of the product where it can be easily seen.
   2. Uses of markers
      * **Mark the incoming non-conforming products**:

        During the IQC inspection, if the number of unqualified products has exceeded the permissible amount, IQC inspectors will hang a sign of "to be processed" on the outer packages of this batch (box or piece) of goods immediately.
      * **Mark the non-conforming products in the process**

        Usually a dedicated "non-conforming product box" will be set next to each machine, assembly table, packaging line, and workstation.

        Employees will put unqualified products, sorted by themselves or determined by the POC, into the "non-conforming product box". When the box is full or the production of the work order is completed, the quantity will be counted by an appointed employee.

        The box should have its label affixed to a certain visible location. The department's PQC will stamp the word **_"Non-conforming" _**or **_"REJECT" _**before placing the box into a designated area.

        If the quality of the goods in batches cannot be determined within the factory and needs to be confirmed externally or by the customer, QC can hang a sign of **_"to be processed"_** or **_"frozen"_** on the store packaging of this batch of goods. These goods will then be placed in the "turnover area" designated by the factory or on-site to wait for the results.
      * **To mark the non-conforming products in storage**

        QC regularly evaluates the quality of the goods in storage. The non-conforming goods are boxed or packaged by the warehouse in a centralized manner. The label _"**UNQUALIFIED" **_or **_"REJECT" _**will be written outside the box. 

        If goods are not determined to be unqualified yet, they will have the label **_"to be processed"_** on its packaging and wait for the further action and/or results. 

3. **Isolation of non-conforming products**
   * Separating areas for non-conforming products
     1.  A dedicated box or bag for non-conforming products shall be placed next to each machine or each station of the working table in each work field (manufacturing/assembly or packaging), to collect unqualified products in the production.
     2. A special area shall be designated next to each machine or each station of the working table in each work field (manufacturing/assembly or packaging), for placing the non-conforming products boxes or bags, which is exactly the "_temporary storage for non-conforming products"._
     3. Each work field and each floor shall have a certain area planned as _"storage for non-conforming products"_, which is used to place unqualified products collected from the production lines.
     4. All _"storage for non-conforming products"_ shall be marked by lines and text with colored paint. The size of the area depends on the quantity of non-conforming products produced by the unit.
   * Placement of signs
     1. If the department has _no_ objection to the non-conforming products determined by QC, the non-conforming products will be packed and labelled. After QC stamps **_"REJECT"_** on the surface of each package, the personnel on site will send them to the _"storage area for non-conforming products_" for stacking and replacement according to the type.
     2. If there is any objection to the non-conforming products determined by QC, the department manager will further consult with the members of the quality management team.
     3. Control of goods in areas for _non-conforming products_
        1. No department or individual is allowed to handle or use the goods in the nonconforming products area without written notice from the Quality Department.
        2. The disposal of non-conforming products should done under the supervision of the Quality Department.

**Discard**: when QC has stamped the words _"discard"_ on the outer box one by one, the handyman will send them to the "waste area" designated by the factory for disposal.

**Rework**: stamp the outer box one by one with the word _"rework"_ or hang a _"rework"_ sign, and the relevant department will carry out the rework, including rework, repair, selection, and selective production.

**Acceptance On Deviation**: QC receives the receipt notice of the goods and all non-conforming marks are canceled. Any words like _“unqualified”_ on the outer box shall be covered with a "green" color band.

Disposal regulations for other non-conforming products: the Quality Department shall inform and assist the relevant departments to deal with them properly according to the regulations.

4. **Disposal of non-conforming products**

   Methods of disposal are different for different nonconforming products. The following methods can be used when dealing with non-conforming products:
   * Acceptance On Deviation (AOD)

     If a non-conforming product can be accepted or used directly without affecting the final performance of the product after being partially reconditioned, it can be regarded as an acceptable product in terms of quality.

     Acceptance of such products is also known as _"acceptance on deviation"_ or _AOD_. When the batch of incoming goods is authorized to be accepted by the factory, IQC shall mark the batch of goods with **_"AOD_**” and transfer the goods along with the inspection information to the relevant departments so corresponding actions can be taken.
   * Picking or selection

     This is specific for incoming good batches which contains mostly qualified goods with a few non-conformed ones. When this occur, the factory will further sort and remove the non-conformed goods before pushing them through for production. This whole process is known as the "_picking or selection of incoming goods"._ 

     If the batch of incoming goods is put into production directly without being selected in advance, but used by the user department for production while selecting, which is called "selective receipt".
   * Rework and repair

     Rework and repair refer to the reprocessing and repairing of non-conforming products to make the product quality meet the specified requirements. Some of the things to be paid attention to includes:
     1. Set a strict permissable standard, and clarify these to the personnel in charge.
     2. Conduct quality inspection and testing methods for products during the rework and repair process.
     3. Record the name, specification, and quantity of the reworked product.
     4. Re-inspect the reworked products.
   * Returns

     Returns refers to the returning the unqualified incoming goods to the delivery department, after the identification by QC. No matter whether the returned goods are made in-house or outsourced, QC should first re-sort the goods before making a decision to return:
     1. Have the incoming goods been accepted through other methods, such as selective receipt or repair.
     2. How important is the role of the returned goods in the final product.  the return goods plays an important role in the products. This involves asking, if using these products would cause a serious impact to the final quality of the products. 
     3. Whether returning the goods would halt the production line. The incoming goods must be returned if the its forced use will cause a hidden risk in quality.
   * Discard

     Since discarding materials will directly cause economic losses to the factory, the Quality Department should carefully checks the discard proposals. QC supervisors or quality management staffs at the supervisory assistant level will then visit the site for verification, to confirm that the applied materials cannot be reused, before approving the product to be discarded.

There are three types of the processing process for the non-conforming products of NexPCB: 

* Management of incoming non-conforming goods
* Management of non-conforming goods in process
* Disposal of after-sales returns from customers.

Quality is the soul of an enterprise. An enterprise cannot be judged through its profit, but also through its quality control system. Strengthening the management of non-conforming products, in one hand will reduce production costs and improve the economic benefits of the company. It also plays an important role in ensuring product quality, thus producing satisfactory products for users, and achieving better social benefits for the company. 

Therefore, enterprises should establish a proper preventive measure to reduce the amount of non-conforming products made. Since it's impossible to eliminate non-conforming products only through inspection, collaborative measures from the product design to production process, along with the inspection in between and after the processes, should be done for effective control. This will improve the company's product qualities, reduce costs, and promote the company's development.

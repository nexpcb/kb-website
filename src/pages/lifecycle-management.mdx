Once you launch a product, its lifecycle has started. It’ll start from the **introduction stage.** Afterward, it’ll **grow**, increase in popularity, and reach, and keeps on maturing until it’s fully developed. (read more about Product Lifecycle)

At this stage, **retaining** the market share in the industry is essential. This requires advanced problem-solving skills. Finally, if your product had finally **declined** in the market, maybe due to a huge problem, or its outdated technology, solutions such as business pivoting or production halt should be considered.

NexPCB is as committed to your product as you are. We will assist you to take active and careful steps throughout the product lifecycle stages to give an optimum outcome.

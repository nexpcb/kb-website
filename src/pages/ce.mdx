In the EU market, the "CE" or "_Conformité Européenne"_ is a compulsory certification. To allow a product to circulate freely in the EU market, the "CE" mark must be affixed to it to indicate that the product complies with the basic requirements of the European Union's _"New Approach to Technical Coordination and Standardization"_ directive. This is a mandatory requirement imposed by EU law on products. No matter whether a product is made within the EU or imported, the same law applies to these products on market.

CE certification means that the **product has met the safety requirements stipulated by the EU directive**. The mark itself shows the commitment of a company to its customers, which establishes the consumer's trust in the product. Hence, products with the CE mark will reduce the risk of sales in the European market.

These sales risks for unmarked products include:

* The risk of being detained and investigated by customs.
* The risk of being investigated and dealt with by the market supervision agency.
* Risk of being accused by peers for competitive purposes.

CE certification is limited to the **basic safety requirements that the product does not endanger the safety of humans, animals, and goods**, rather than general quality requirements. The harmonized directives only stipulate the main requirements, and the general directive requirements are standard tasks. Therefore, the precise meaning is: the CE mark is a **safety conformity mark rather than a quality conformity mark**, and it is the "main requirement" that constitutes the core of the European directive.

## Cycle and Validity Period

Typically, the CE certification process takes about **10 working days from the submission of materials.** 

The **electronic certificate** will be made publicly available on the organization's official website **within 3 working days of issuance**. 

The cost of CE certification can range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the technical parameters of the product. The cost is mainly based on the relevant directives and applicable standards. For example, the CE certification cost for a consumer electronic is typically lower than that for most medical devices. CE certification is based on the risk associated with the product, and the relevant testing and certification are carried out accordingly. 

The validity of the CE certification also depends on the risk of the product, relevant standards and guidelines, and any significant changes in production processes or raw materials. The CE certificate is typically **valid until the product is changed or updated in a way that affects its compliance with the relevant legislation**. For products with relatively _high risk_, **follow-up assessments (FPC)** are conducted annually to maintain the validity of the certificate.

## Documents Required for CE Applications

The exact documents required for the CE certification process will vary depending on the specific product and the applicable European legislation. However, some common documents that may be required include:

1. Technical documentation: Detailed technical information about the product, including its design, construction, and performance.
2. Test reports: Results from laboratory testing or other assessments that demonstrate that the product meets the relevant safety, health, and environmental protection requirements.
3. Declarations of Conformity: A statement signed by the manufacturer or importer declaring that the product meets the relevant requirements of the applicable legislation.
4. User manuals: Information that helps users operate the product safely and effectively.
5. Safety assessments: An analysis of the potential risks associated with the product and a demonstration that these risks have been adequately addressed.
6. Quality management system documentation: Information about the manufacturer's quality management system, including procedures for design, production, and testing.
7. Product labeling and marking: Information about the product that must be displayed on the product or its packaging, such as the CE mark and the manufacturer's name and address.

It is important to note that the specific documentation requirements will vary depending on the product and the relevant legislation. Companies should consult the relevant legislation and guidelines and seek advice from a Notified Body to ensure that they have all the required documentation for the CE certification process.

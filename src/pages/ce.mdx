In the EU market, the "CE" is a compulsory certification. No matter if a product is produced within the EU region or is imported if it wants to circulate freely in the EU market, the "CE" mark must be affixed to indicate that the product complies with the basic requirements of the European Union's "New Approach to Technical Coordination and Standardization" directive. This is a mandatory requirement imposed by EU law on products.

CE certification means that the product has met the safety requirements stipulated by the EU directive; it is a commitment of the enterprise to consumers, which increases the trust of consumers in the product; products with the CE mark will reduce the risk of sales in the European market.

These risks include:

●The risk of being detained and investigated by the customs;

●The risk of being investigated and dealt with by the market supervision agency;

●Risk of being accused by peers for competitive purposes.

CE certification is limited to the basic safety requirements that the product does not endanger the safety of humans, animals and goods, rather than general quality requirements. The harmonized directives only stipulate the main requirements, and the general directive requirements are standard tasks. Therefore, the precise meaning is: the CE mark is a safety conformity mark rather than a quality conformity mark, and it is the "main requirement" that constitutes the core of the European directive.

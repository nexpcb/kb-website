Summarized below are the general clearance requirements and tolerance capabilities of our manufacturing and assembly processes. A selection of copper track widths for different copper weights are also given within.

## Clearances

Clearance is the minimum distance required between two points on a PCB to avoid manufacturing, assembly, and general operational failures.

The component to component clearance are decided using the rules in the following table.

## Tolerances

Tolerance is the machining accuracy attainable to produce each feature on a PCB.

The standard tolerance for PCB contours, slots, and cut-outs is **±0.15mm**

### Holes

| Hole Type | Position Tolerance | Diameter Tolerance |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| NPTH      | ±0.075mm           | ±0.05 ~ ±0.075mm   |
| PTH       | ±0.075mm           | ±0.05 ~ ±0.1mm     |
| Vias      | ±0.05mm            | ±0.05mm            |

### Traces

| Trace Width | Tolerance |
| ----------- | --------- |
| ≤10 mil     | ±1.0 mil  |
| >10 mil     | ±1.5 mil  |

### Solder Mask

Solder mask should have an opening with a size bigger than 2 mils, and a bridge greater than 6 mils.

The characters to be printed as the silkscreen should have a character line width to character height ratio of 1:5. The commonly used character line sizes are

- 4/20mil,
- 5/25mil,
- and 6/30mil.

NSF (Next Stage Framework) is NexPCB's unique take to simplify the stages of innovation, product development, and production, also business advancement stages.

The framework will be commonly used for hardware startups, in which they'll need to first do some prototyping, funding, and molding, before finally launching their product in the market.

We generally segment the stages into 6, based on the innovation curve stages:

**S0:** The S0 stage is the starting point. Whenever you're starting a project or creating a new product, you'll always first start here. It's also the _ideation stage_. During this stage, you'll spend a lot of time designing, researching, and learning about what to do, when to do it, and how to optimize your design.

**S1-S2:** During these stages, continuous, iterative prototyping are done to finally establish a valid **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** and **Proof of Concept (POC).** Using the MVP, you'll need to focus on **securing funding** to move to the next round of production. 

**S3:** In the S3 stage, hardware products generally start to create a mold for their plastic parts, and optimize their casings or enclosures. Typically, a QC standard approach will be established at this stage.

**S4-S6:** In the last 3 stages, the production volume is increased step by step. During this time, the quality, cost, and time for production will be optimized. Ensuring that the production cycle can occur at the optimum pace.

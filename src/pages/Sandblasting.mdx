The sandblasting process is an abrasive process of pre-smoothing metal surfaces before having their surface treated. Compressed air shoots the abrasive medium to ‘sweep’ the metal surfaces. NexPCB usually uses quartz sand as the medium to create a matte effect.  

Sandblasting process is mostly used on the outer surface of a metal. Plastics are not recommended for sandblasting processes as they are more easily damaged. Also, since internal structures are usually more complex, sandblasting is not recommended for the internal parts.

In-mold Lamination or In-mold Decoration (IMD) adds a layer of laminating film into the mold during the injection molding process. 

The process is often preferred since it realizes fully automatic production, which improves efficiency and reduces costs. It also gets coloring done in a single step. In-mold lamination, unlike regular laminating processes (i.e., post-mold lamination), gives a more durable finish. 

The advantages of using in-mold lamination include:

-   The laminated label doesn't fall off as easily, 

-   It's not easily damaged and torn

-   Generally water and oil proof

-   Mildewproof

-   Acid and alkali resistant

-   Doesn't shrink at low temperatures 

The lamination material needs to be chosen according to the material of the workpiece, as melting temperatures and cycle times need to be matched within the mold.

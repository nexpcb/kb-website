NexPCB provides various services, from **innovation consulting** to **NP**I, **engineering acceleration**, and **lifecycle management** services. Since we handle numerous customers with different backgrounds, we need to purchase hundreds or thousands of different materials and components. This process of procurement management might be a huge challenge for many companies. How can we find an effective way to manage the procurement of thousands of materials?

In the traditional industry of manufacturing, materials are managed based on the ABC classification. The basic idea of the ABC classification method is to classify materials according to their value.

For example:

* Class A covers expensive materials such as integrated circuits and LCD screens. 
* Class B covers materials or components that are not too expensive, but not too cheap. 
* Class C covers materials in full packages that are usually purchased due to low value. 

Most companies are still doing their material sourcing this way. A drawback for this method of classification is that it **can't reflect either the urgency of the materials, the cost fluctuation of materials, or the level of difficulty in sourcing the materials in the market.** 

Since the pandemic, the supply chain has been constrained these last 2 years. Various industries experienced material shortages or even shutdowns. In this case, a better procurement strategy is needed to manage the procurement of materials. What are the factors to be considered in formulating a purchasing strategy?

First, we can differentiate the materials through 2 methods of classification, that is:

1\. Based on the importance of the material

2\. Based on its readability in the supply market.

Therefore, we classify the materials in the following methods: key materials, materials of concern, and conventional materials.

* **Key materials** - are very essential for production, but the supply market is complicated, as the materials themselves are irreplaceable and scarce in the market.
* **Materials of concern** - materials, usually utilized in large quantities, are substitutable but also easily in short supply, due to being monopolized by large demand.
* **Conventional materials** - common and more readily available materials.

How shall we manage these three types of materials in the actual procurement process? Before executing the procurement process, we first should have a **procurement budget**. The preparation of a procurement budget depends on the product’s stage of development and the business or production plan for the next eighteen months.

### Sourcing Strategy at Different Development Stages

We’ve summarized an effective sourcing strategy from NPI (New Product Introduction) to mass production.

The NPI stage is made up of several stages: **design, prototyping, pilot run, ramp up,** then ends at the **mass production stage.** Each of these stages will take around 2-3 months.

**Sourcing for Design to Ramp-up Stage**

Total demand from design to pilot run generally does not exceed 1000 pcs, and the process will take around 6-12 months. However, this demand will not be the same. The production quantity will only be stabler in the mass production stage.

Generally, the delivery time of key materials is around 26-52 weeks, some even took longer than that. It all depends on the supply chain situation. Hence, to manage the stocks, key materials should be bought before and after mass production, ASAP once you’ve confirmed your project.

Total demand from design to ramp up generally does not exceed 1000 pcs, and the process will take around 6-12 months. However, the product demand during these stages isn’t very stable yet. The production quantity will only be stabler in the mass production stage.

**Sourcing for Mass Production**

Before moving to mass production, you can already start preparing the budget to source the materials around the ramp-up or pilot run stages. By doing this, the workload during the material preparation process could be reduced. 

To a certain extent, the procurement process of materials can also be done in the early stages of the project, to first guarantee the availability of the materials to be used.

You can start sourcing the materials once the prototyping stage is completed. During this time, the materials in the BOM list are already classified into key materials, materials of concern, and conventional materials. The key materials are sorted by day or week, the materials of concern are sorted by week or month, and conventional materials can be put aside temporarily. List the basic information of spot price, order price, standard delivery time, MPQ, and MOQ of key materials and materials of concern, to ease making the purchasing decisions for those materials according to the market changes at any time.

**Key Materials**

Key materials will be fixed once the product design is finalized. There won’t be any alternative materials or components for the part. This means its purchase should be secured as soon as possible, based on the expected progress of the product. The sourcing process should be sorted within days or weeks after the design or prototyping stage. 

Most key materials are directly ordered from the factory or through an agent. In most cases, you don’t have to directly make a payment to order, Instead, an NCNR agreement or deposit payments can be done to place the order.

If by any chance the product delivery runs faster than the sourcing process of the key materials, companies can alter to conduct **partial shipments**. This means, some of the goods will be shipped first to us, and the rest of the goods will be shipped afterward. By doing so, the progress of the product can still be continued.

**Materials of Concern**

Materials of concern might not be as important as key materials. However, if its procurement process is not paid attention to, delivery problems often arise. The problem in delivery will affect the cost and delivery time, and thus hinders the product development process. Materials of concern are usually sorted within weeks or months after the design and prototyping stage is finalized. 

Within the category, many of the materials are used widely for various uses. If larger enterprises have a sudden large demand for the said product, the producing factory will prioritize these key customers. Following the supply-demand curve, since the supply for the product has now become lower, the price for the product will arise.

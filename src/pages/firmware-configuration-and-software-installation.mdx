Since the market for new tech is continuously expanding, the demand for electronic products has also been increasing. This means software developments for electronic products are also becoming more and more important. It's one of the most crucial steps in the production of electronic products, and is indispensable. 

The rapid development of electronic technology has led to the emergence of various types of controllers (MCUs) on the market, followed by the emergence of various programming software and test software to adapt to the development of different controllers. At the same time, different products and different applications have different firmware needs to be configured. This not only brings difficulty to the front-end developers but also brings a daunting challenge to the back-end production testing.

firmware configuration

The so-called firmware (Firmware) is the program written in EPROM or EEPROM, and the popular understanding is "solidified software". To put it more simply, Firmware is BIOS software, but it is completely different from ordinary software. It is the program code solidified inside the integrated circuit, which is responsible for controlling and coordinating the functions of the integrated circuit.

Firmware refers to the device "driver" stored inside the device. Through firmware, the operating system can realize the operation of a specific machine according to the standard device driver. For example, CD-ROM drives and recorders all have internal firmware.

Firmware acts as the software for the most basic and bottom-level work of a system. In hardware devices, firmware is the soul of hardware devices, because some hardware devices have no other software components except firmware, so firmware also determines the function and performance of hardware devices.

Through the above definition and description of firmware, we have clearly understood the importance of firmware, so when designing and manufacturing products, the configuration of firmware is particularly important. We need to build firmware very rigorously and carefully. It is true that there are many devices that can upgrade firmware, but there are still many devices that, once used, will never have the opportunity to change.

At the same time, designers should consider the ease of firmware download to reduce the difficulty and complexity of production. In the products that NEXPCB has served in the past, we always negotiate with customers and suggest that customers modify and improve the process and operation mode of configuring/downloading firmware, so as to make the products easy to produce and test, and speed up the time of product landing.

Software Installation

Whenever we do product development, we always encounter different software that needs to be installed at various stages of product development. In product design, we need different IDEs to program and debug the microcontroller. During product testing, we need various software to download code. to verify our functionality. However, various IDEs also bring huge challenges to production.

We always tend to popular and universal IDEs for development verification and functional testing. This is conducive to our accurate positioning of unknown problems, rather than being unable to locate the key points of the problem due to ignorance of the software.

Summarize

Both firmware and software are an important part of the production design process. Factors such as efficiency, functionality, and simplicity need to be fully considered.

NEXPCB is committed to optimizing the manufacturability of products and accelerating product realization. Constantly seek the best solution in terms of firmware configuration and software installation. Help customers save time in product development and verification.

## What is anti-static (ESD)

ESD (Electro-Static discharge) is a discipline formed in the mid-20th century to study the production, risk, and protection of static electricity. Hence, the population has become accustomed to calling electrostatic protective equipment ESD. 

Normally, electrical appliances ESD only shows an extremely low capacitive reactance (generally <5pf), which has no effect on its operation. However, when a device overvoltages, ; when the device When the overvoltage at both ends reaches the predetermined breakdown voltage, it responds quickly (nanosecond level) and amplifies the leakage current between electrodes in a geometric progression, so as to absorb and weaken the interference and influence of static electricity on circuit characteristics. At the same time, due to the particularity of the constituent materials of the ESD electrostatic resistor, ESD often achieves electrostatic protection for the equipment by absorbing and dissipating static electricity, that is, a charging and discharging process, so the ESD in the equipment Electrostatic resistors are not easily damaged by aging.

The generation of static electricity:

Static electricity is an objectively existing natural phenomenon, which can be produced in many ways, such as contact, friction, induction between electrical appliances, etc. Static electricity is characterized by long-term accumulation, high voltage, low power, small current and short action time.

The action of the human body or the contact, separation, friction or induction with other objects can generate thousands of volts or even tens of thousands of volts of static electricity.

The hazards of static electricity:

Static electricity causes serious harm in many fields. Friction electrification and human body static electricity are two major hazards in the electronics industry, which often cause unstable operation or even damage of electronic and electrical products. For some sensitive instruments, this voltage may be a fatal hazard.

What is anti-static packaging:

In addition to static conductors used in anti-static packaging products, most of them are made of static dissipative materials, and some are made of anti-static materials. The purpose is to protect the installed circuit or device and the printed circuit from static electricity.

Main categories:

There are many anti-static packaging products, such as anti-static shielding bags, anti-static bubble bags, aluminum foil bags, aluminized bags, anti-static sponges, anti-static mesh bags, anti-static trays, etc.

Anti-static shielding bag:

Use two-layer composite or higher four-layer structure. The Faraday cage induction cover effect is formed in the bag, which protects the items in the bag from the electrostatic field to the greatest extent, prevents the accumulation of static electricity, and avoids static electricity hazards. It is often used in the packaging of electronic components to prevent damage caused by static electricity that is prone to occur in electronic components. Commonly used are open buckle and closed

Advantages and features: anti-static, anti-radio frequency, waterproof vapor penetration, anti-salt spray, etc. The outer layer is made of transparent anti-static material, and the middle is a translucent conductive metal layer. The appearance is silver-gray and translucent, and the packaged objects can be seen through. It can be made into flat bags, zipper bags, organ bags, three-dimensional bags and other forms. Widely used in static-sensitive electronic products such as computer motherboards, sound cards, and graphics cards.

Anti-static bubble bag:

Packaging for lighter products and products with general requirements. Its characteristic is to achieve the shockproof and buffering effect through this sealed airbag, and at the same time, it can also imitate static electricity to a certain extent (generally, self-sealing and opening are commonly used).

Foil bag:

Also known as pure aluminum bag, it usually refers to aluminum-plastic composite vacuum packaging bag. It can be well protected from moisture, light, water, oxygen, high temperature or low temperature, and the shape is stable. It can also avoid the accumulation of electrons in the product during the friction movement, which will cause discharge and cause damage to static sensitive products. It also has the effect of blocking the mutual interference effect of different electromagnetic fields on the product. And without restrictions, the size and style can be customized according to the volume. (flat mouth, three-dimensional bags, organ bags, etc.).

Points to note: The product needs to be tested by GB and ASTM standards, and the product meets the requirements of environmental protection (third-party test report can be provided)

Aluminum bag:

Aluminized bag: It is formed by evenly distributing high-purity aluminum on plastic under high temperature and vacuum. The production cost of aluminum foil bags is higher than that of aluminum-plated bags, and there are obvious differences in the process between the two.

Aluminized film self-adhesive bubble bag: the outer layer is aluminized film (multiple colors) with smooth surface, and different patterns, trademarks and words can be printed according to requirements. Lined with bubble film, it has the function of cushioning and shockproof, and can also prevent the product from being damaged due to pressure, touch and drop.

Anti-static sponge:

It is processed by adding an appropriate amount of conductive substances to plastics. The hard type is used for inserting integrated circuit chips, and the soft type is used for anti-static packaging. Anti-static sponge is a dissipative material between conductive and insulating materials.

Anti-static mesh bag:

Blow molded from LDPE and LLDPE, with anti-static properties and intuitive understanding of the contents. Comply with RoHS standards (environmental protection, pollution-free, recyclable) and international anti-static testing standards; color, size, opening method, etc. can be customized.

Advantages and Features:

1\. It has good barrier properties, heat sealing properties, anti-oxidation, waterproof and moisture-proof;

2\. Strong mechanical properties, high blast resistance, strong puncture and tear resistance;

3\. High temperature resistance, low temperature resistance, oil resistance, good fragrance retention performance; non-toxic and tasteless;

4\. Softness, high transparency; dustproof, antibacterial, moistureproof, etc.

Anti-static tray:

It is made of special material blister and PP plastic, and the resistance value of the surface of the material is below 10 to the 6th power or from 10 to the 11th power ohm. Due to the addition of special polymer chains in the raw materials, the finished product has permanent static dissipative properties. The finished product has good mechanical strength and heat resistance; good impact resistance and strong chemical corrosion resistance. It will not change its antistatic performance due to the environment, time and temperature.

Advantages and features: anti-bending, anti-aging, high load-bearing strength, tensile, compression, tearing, high temperature, made into a box-type turnover box, which can be used for both turnover and finished product shipment packaging, lightweight, durable, and stack. Various specifications and sizes can be customized according to user needs, and can be equipped with covers, dust-proof, anti-static, and beautiful in appearance. Generally, the anti-static tray is designed and manufactured according to the size provided by the customer to achieve the most reasonable loading, and multiple trays can be overlapped to effectively use the factory space, increase the storage capacity of electronic components, PCB boards, and dust-free workshop components, and save production costs.

What is custom packaging?

Custom packaging is a unique package designed from scratch around the specific needs of customers and products, rather than using a standard or prefabricated box or packaging, as close as possible to product placement, shipping, and sales. The custom packaging process includes modifying the shape, size, style, color, material, varnish, and other specifications of the packaging, etc.

Why do products need custom packaging?

Customized packaging plays a vital role in product sales. Whether it is the embodiment of the brand, the communication of product information or the enhancement of visual appeal, it is closely related to packaging. Well-designed packaging helps the brand stand out from the competition, enhances the customer's impression of the brand, and potential customers can feel the value of the product through the packaging. It can also attract target customers through eye-catching design and creative structural design. Product packaging is like a billboard for products. With the continuous improvement of living standards, people's visual requirements are also gradually increasing. The unique design can stimulate customers' curiosity and desire to buy.

Customization method:

Customers provide products, and we provide packaging design and customization according to product characteristics and sales needs;

Provide specific needs, we provide packaging design consultation and customization according to needs. Customers need to be notified: size, size, material, thickness, style, printing method, printing process, customized quantity (generally, the more the quantity, the lower the price), additional processes, etc. Because it involves proofing, loss, etc., it is necessary to know all the requirements in order to achieve accurate quotations. For example, the thickness and material of paper (cardboard + special paper / double copper paper / single powder card, etc.) will affect the price fluctuation, complex printing process (bronzing / embossing / lamination / die-cutting / partial UV / reverse glazing, etc. ) will increase the difficulty of proofing, etc.
